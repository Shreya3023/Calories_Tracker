# Calories_Tracker üçî
This Application uses coredata to store and retrieve the data.
The application requires the user to input the food name and the calories intake from the food through a slider.
It presents the users a list of food with the calories and sums up the total calories along with the time when it was added.
The user can add new food items to the list using the plus button at the top right corner.
One can also delete the food items using the edit button or swiping the item to the left.

Here are a few attachments of the screensorts
